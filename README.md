Firstly, I would like to apologize, I did not consider adequate time for the task, and I ended up having a lot of difficulties in terms of consuming the API, I spent many hours trying to fix BackEnd problems and was unable to dedicate myself to the frontend or meet the necessary requirements for the application. . Due to lack of time I managed to complete few parts of the task, although in my mind I had planned to do much more, I believe that my biggest difficulty and failure was having spent a lot of time trying to correct connection problems with the API, however the test as far as I was able to do It served as a great experience and further learning for me.

I used some methods to facilitate the execution of Node on the backend such as nodemon, dotnev and a cross manager for permission on the frontend, as well as postman to check the GET and POST of the API. 

As for the frontend application to create the graph, my idea was to use the recharts library for better visualization, unfortunately I was unable to put my ideas into practice and there were many interesting features that I would like to add to the application. By the way, it initially started to be developed in Next, but as I'm still not used to the new routing system in Next 13+ where the approach to creating routes has changed, I preferred to return to React, prioritizing delivery and code quality. 


Use "npm ./index.js" to run the backend and NPM start to run the Frontend.
